### Definitions


###### Program (Application)

A program or application is a piece of software that runs on the system. Sometimes shortened to just "App."


###### Service

A service is essentially just a [Program] that runs in the background of the system. Similar to what's known in the [UNIX]/[Linux] world as a [daemon process].

Some services may run as the user that is logged in, where as other services may run under the [System] or [root user].








#### FAQ

###### What inspired the creation of Universal OS?

Many factors were involved. The main one being having a beautiful, effective, functional, simplistic, and clean alternative to "current-day" Linux-distributions desktop environments.


###### Do I need anti-virus software?

Universal OS is built similarly to Mac OS and GNU/Linux as to where the system protects itself through [various] means and therefore does not require anti-malware software.




#### Addendum

##### Alternatives Operating Systems

We are inspired by projects like UNIX and GNU/Linux and encourage alternatives to exist!

If you are looking for a Linux distribution that is similar to Universal OS, we suggest [GoboLinux](https://gobolinux.org/) and [Debian Linux](https://debian.org/).
